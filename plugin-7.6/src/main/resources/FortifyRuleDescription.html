 <p>HPE Security Fortify Static Code Analyzer (SCA) is used by development groups and security professionals to analyze 
 the source code of an application for security issues. Using the Fortify SonarQube plug-in, potential vulnerabilities 
 detected by SCA can be reviewed from within SonarQube.</p>
 
 <p>Due to different approaches between SCA and SonarQube for defining rules, scanning source code and presenting the
 results, this plug-in works a bit different than most other SonarQube plug-ins:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>The plug-in collects metrics and issues from Fortify Software Security Center (SSC).
  	<ul>
  	 <li>As such, source code needs to be scanned separately by SCA and results uploaded to SSC before running 
  	     SonarQube analysis to include those results in SonarQube.</li>
  	 <li>Allows for using the full Fortify ecosystem to optimize SCA scan coverage and accuracy.</li>
  	 <li>Allows for using SSC issue templates for organizing and filtering issues, for example based on audit data.</li>
  	 <li>Allows for re-use of SSC metrics like variables and performance indicators.</li>
  	</ul>
  </li>
  <li>All Fortify vulnerabilities are mapped to a single catch-all SonarQube rule (for each supported SonarQube language).
   <ul>
    <li>SonarQube requires the list of all supported rules to be available at plug-in load time.</li>
    <li>However, different Fortify scans may use different rule sets, for example different standard rule pack versions
        or different sets of custom rules.</li>
    <li>Fortify does not provide a public API to retrieve the list of standard rule categories since this is considered
        intellectual property.</li>
   </ul>
  </li>
 </ul>
