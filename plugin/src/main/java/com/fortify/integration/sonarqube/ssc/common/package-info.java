/**
 * <p>This package contains common SonarQube plugin code that is shared between the
 * various version-specific plugin implementations. Any code in this package and
 * sub-packages should compile without any errors against all SonarQube API versions
 * that are supported by the plugin. Also, unless there is no work-around, all code
 * should compile against the latest supported SonarQube API version without any 
 * deprecation warnings. Compatibility with specific SonarQube API versions can be
 * easily verified using the various Maven profiles (see the root pom.xml file).</p>
 * 
 * <p>In general, this package provides the following functionality:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Helpers classes and common functionality like connection handling.</li>
 *   <li>Full implementations for SonarQube extensions that are shared as-is 
 *       between the various version-specific implementations; the SonarQube
 *       API's and annotations used by these extensions are fully supported
 *       and not deprecated for all supported SonarQube API versions.</p>
 *   <li>Partial implementations for SonarQube extensions for which a full
 *       implementation cannot be provided without depending on API's that
 *       have been deprecated in the latest SonarQube API version. The 
 *       version-specific packages extend these partial implementations by
 *       adding the version-specific SonarQube annotations.<br/><br/>
 *       Note that in most cases, we could have simply provided a single
 *       implementation used for all supported SonarQube API versions, using
 *       API's and annotations that are deprecated in the latest API version; 
 *       likely these deprecated API's are still supported by the current
 *       latest SonarQube version. However the use of deprecated annotations 
 *       and API's increases the likelihood that the plugin will no longer 
 *       function with future SonarQube versions, if support for these deprecated
 *       API's is dropped completely. As such, the plugin implementation for the 
 *       latest available SonarQube version (including any common code) should
 *       avoid the use of deprecated API's, to make the plugin as future-proof
 *       as possible.</li> 
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>In practice, most of the scanner/batch-side annotations and interfaces have 
 * been deprecated somewhere between SonarQube API versions 6.7 and 7.6. As such,
 * for all scanner/batch-side extensions, only a partial implementation is provided
 * in this common package.</p>
 * 
 * <p>In most cases, the version-specific extensions just needs to extend from the 
 * partial implementation class provided in the common package, and add the relevant 
 * version-specific annotations. For sensors, also some interfaces and bases classes
 * have been deprecated, so the version-specific implementations are further apart.</p>
