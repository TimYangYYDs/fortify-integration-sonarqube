 * SonarQube only processes files with the file suffixes supported by
 * these language plugins. The Fortify scan results may include file 
 * extensions that are not handled by any of the installed SonarQube
 * language plugins; this would mean that vulnerabilities in these files
 * cannot be included in the SonarQube results.</p>

 * including these file types in the SonarQube results, such that the
 * corresponding Fortify vulnerabilities can be reported in SonarQube.</p>
 *

 * versions by {@link FortifyPlugin}.</p>
