# Introduction
This SonarQube plug-in allows for importing Fortify scan results into SonarQube. This includes the following features:

* Load vulnerability data from Fortify SSC or Fortify on Demand, and display each vulnerability as a SonarQube issue
* Load various metrics and other meta-data from Fortify SSC or FoD, like issue counts and artifact status. 
    * These metrics can be used to define Quality Gates.
