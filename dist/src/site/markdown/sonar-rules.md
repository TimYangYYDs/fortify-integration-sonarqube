# Fortify SonarQube rules
Contrary to earlier versions of the plugin, all Fortify-related rules are now defined under the
'Fortify' language. The plugin defines a default quality profile with all Fortify-related rules 
enabled, so you no longer need to manually enable Fortify-related rules for the various 
SonarQube-supported languages.

Of course, you can still disable specific Fortify-related rules in the Fortify Quality Profile 
to prevent any vulnerabilities corresponding to these rules to be loaded into SonarQube.
