Update README.md

Plugin:
- Issue collection
  - SCA, Other (WebInspect, SonaType, ...)?
  - Works for SQ 7.6, doesn't work for 6.7.7, not sure about versions inbetween
    - SQ 7.6 provides a project-level filesystem, whereas earlier versions only provide filesystems for individual modules
    - For older versions we may need to revert to the older method of reporting issues per module, but we should cache issue data to prevent re-loading issues from SSC for every module
  - Configurable mapping between friority and SonarQube severity
  - Configurable support for using folder instead of friority to determine SonarQube severity
  - Map Fortify issues to SonarQube-provided OWASP Top 10/SANS Top 25 Security Reports
- Web pages 
  - Show information similar to previous widget
- Clean-up/remove FortifyConstants
- Add/improve error handling
- Remove scanner warnings: [WARNING] Storing measures on folders or modules is deprecated. Provided value of metric ... is ignored
  - Apparently measures cannot be saved on modules with packaging type pom 
- Check whether hidden metric to pass SSC URL/credentials is somehow visible (for example through API)
  
Metrics:
- Add support and default metrics for folder counts
- Add support for default value if no value available from SSC?
- Fortify security rating -> SonarQube rating (RATING metric type) in metrics.yml

Configuration utility:
- Hide MetricDetailsPanel if no item selected in listMetrics
- Add validation (duplicate metric keys, test metric expressions by loading application version from SSC)
- Add help information/tooltips for various input fields 
- Remove hardcoded SSC URL (replace with generic sample URL) & credentials
- Add support for configuring default values for plugin PropertyDefinitions?
  - How to keep property definitions in sync between plugin and configuration tool?
  - Hot to avoid code duplication?

Build:
- Remove unnecessary elements in pom.xml files if already defined in parent
- Fix warnings

Tests:
- Multi-module project/Single-module project
- Sonar Scanner/Maven scanner
- Different SonarQube versions
