Update README.md

Plugin:
- Issue collection
  - SCA, Other (WebInspect, SonaType, ...)?
  - Retrieve only issue fields that are actually necessary for plugin operation
  - Cache issues (see FortifyBugTrackerUtility for disk-backed map example used for grouping)
  - Configurable mapping between friority and SonarQube severity
  - Configurable support for using folder instead of friority to determine SonarQube severity
  - Map Fortify issues to SonarQube-provided OWASP Top 10/SANS Top 25 Security Reports
- FPR file is not uploaded if issue collection is disabled
- Web pages 
  - Show information similar to previous widget
- Clean up/remove FortifyConstants
- Remove code duplication between MetricValueTypeHelper and MetricsConfig (both have functionality for mapping metric types to Java types)
- Refactoring:
  - IFortifyMetricsProvider must be enabled for all SQ sides (due to providing metric definitions), but this means
    that any component implementing this interface is automatically enabled for all SQ sides. This means that any
    dependencies for such a component must also be enabled for all sides, for example FortifySSCConnectionFactory.
    At the moment having FortifySSCConnectionFactory available on server/CE side doesn't make sense, as it doesn't
    receive batch-side configuration options like current SSC application name and version.
  - Refactor FortifySSCConnectionFactory such that it can be used on all sides (also see below about MeasureComputer)
  
Metrics:
- Add support and default metrics for folder counts
- Add support for default value if no value available from SSC?
- Add support for retrieving metrics in MeasureComputer instead of Sensor
  - Save SSC URL, credentials and applicationVersionNameOrId in metrics
  - In MeasureComputer, use these metrics to configure new connection to SSC


Configuration utility:
- Hide MetricDetailsPanel if no item selected in listMetrics
- Add validation (duplicate metric keys, test metric expressions by loading application version from SSC)
- Add help information/tooltips for various input fields 
- Remove hardcoded SSC URL (replace with generic sample URL) & credentials
- Add support for configuring default values for plugin PropertyDefinitions?
  - How to keep property definitions in sync between plugin and configuration tool?
  - Hot to avoid code duplication?

Build:
- Remove unnecessary elements in pom.xml files if already defined in parent
- Fix warnings

Test:
- Multi-module project
