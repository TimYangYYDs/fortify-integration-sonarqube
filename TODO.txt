Update README.md

Plugin:
- Issue collection
  - SCA
  - Other (WebInspect, SonaType, ...)
  - Retrieve only issue fields that are actually necessary for plugin operation
  - Cache issues (see FortifyBugTrackerUtility for disk-backed map)
  - Configurable mapping between friority and SonarQube severity
  - Configurable support for using folder instead of friority to determine SonarQube severity
- FPR file is not uploaded if issue collection is disabled
- Web pages 
  - Show information similar to previous widget
- Clean up/remove FortifyConstants
- Remove code duplication between MetricValueTypeHelper and MetricsConfig (both have functionality for mapping metric types to Java types)
  
Metrics:
- Add support and default metrics for folder counts
- Add support for default value if no value available from SSC?
- Add support for retrieving metrics in MeasureComputer instead of Sensor
  - Save SSC URL, credentials and applicationVersionNameOrId in metrics
  - In MeasureComputer, use these metrics to configure new connection to SSC


Configuration utility:
- Hide MetricDetailsPanel if no item selected in listMetrics
- Add validation (duplicate metric keys, test metric expressions by loading application version from SSC)
- Add help information/tooltips for various input fields 
- Remove hardcoded SSC URL (replace with generic sample URL) & credentials
- Add support for configuring default values for plugin PropertyDefinitions?
  - How to keep property definitions in sync between plugin and configuration tool?
  - Hot to avoid code duplication?

Build:
- Remove unnecessary elements in pom.xml files if already defined in parent
- Fix warnings

Test:
- Multi-module project
