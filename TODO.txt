Update README.md

Plugin general:
- Configurable mapping between friority and SonarQube severity
- Configurable support for using folder instead of friority to determine SonarQube severity
- Web pages 
  - Show information similar to previous widget
- Clean-up/remove FortifyConstants
- Add/improve error handling
- Check whether hidden metrics to pass SSC/FoD URL/credentials are somehow visible (for example through API)


Plugin on SQ 6.7:
- Remove scanner warnings: [WARNING] Storing measures on folders or modules is deprecated. Provided value of metric ... is ignored
  - Apparently measures cannot be saved on modules with packaging type pom
- Add FoD implementation 

Plugin on SQ 7.6:
- Map Fortify issues to SonarQube-provided OWASP Top 10/SANS Top 25 Security Reports
- Add FortifyIssueRuleKeyRetrieverAdHoc that generates SonarQube ad-hoc rules for Fortify categories
  - First check whetehr ad hoc rules are supported for regular issues
  - If enabled (through configuration utility, as alternative for single Fortify rule/external lists):
    - Don't generate any Fortify-related rules/repositories/profiles
    - Add additional issue query fields to retrieve rule description
    - Generate (and cache) ad-hoc rule based on rule description in issue data  

  
Metrics:
- Add support and default metrics for folder counts
- Add support for default value if no value available from SSC?
- Fortify security rating -> SonarQube rating (RATING metric type) in metrics-*.yml

Configuration utility:
- Hide MetricDetailsPanel if no item selected in listMetrics
- Add validation (duplicate metric keys, test metric expressions by loading application version from SSC)
- Add help information/tooltips for various input fields 
- Remove hardcoded SSC URL (replace with generic sample URL) & credentials
- Add support for configuring default values for plugin PropertyDefinitions?
  - How to keep property definitions in sync between plugin and configuration tool?
  - Hot to avoid code duplication?

Build:
- Remove unnecessary elements in pom.xml files if already defined in parent
- Fix warnings

Tests:
- Sonar Scanner/Maven scanner
- No exceptions if SSC/FoD connection details have not been configured
- Combinations of FoD/SSC, Single/externallist-based rules, different SonarQube versions , single/multi-module projects
