Update README.md

Plugin:
- Issue collection
  - SCA, Other (WebInspect, SonaType, ...)?
  - Retrieve only issue fields that are actually necessary for plugin operation
  - Cache issues (see FortifyBugTrackerUtility for disk-backed map example used for grouping)
  - Configurable mapping between friority and SonarQube severity
  - Configurable support for using folder instead of friority to determine SonarQube severity
  - Map Fortify issues to SonarQube-provided OWASP Top 10/SANS Top 25 Security Reports
  - Why is Fortify profile selected instead of Java profile?
- Web pages 
  - Show information similar to previous widget
- Clean-up/remove FortifyConstants
- Add/improve error handling
- Remove scanner warnings: [WARNING] Storing measures on folders or modules is deprecated. Provided value of metric ... is ignored
  - Apparently measures cannot be saved on modules with packaging type pom 
- Check whether hidden metric to pass SSC URL/credentials is somehow visible (for example through API)
  
Metrics:
- Add support and default metrics for folder counts
- Add support for default value if no value available from SSC?
- Fortify security rating -> SonarQube rating (RATING metric type) in metrics.yml

Configuration utility:
- Hide MetricDetailsPanel if no item selected in listMetrics
- Add validation (duplicate metric keys, test metric expressions by loading application version from SSC)
- Add help information/tooltips for various input fields 
- Remove hardcoded SSC URL (replace with generic sample URL) & credentials
- Add support for configuring default values for plugin PropertyDefinitions?
  - How to keep property definitions in sync between plugin and configuration tool?
  - Hot to avoid code duplication?

Build:
- Remove unnecessary elements in pom.xml files if already defined in parent
- Fix warnings

Test:
- Multi-module project
